# FDE Accuracy Issues Tracker

A specialized tool designed for Full-stack Development Engineers (FDEs) and Product Managers to track, analyze, and resolve AI/Agent accuracy issues across multiple customers.

## 🧐 Problem Statement

Managing accuracy issues in AI deployments is complex. FDEs often struggle with:
- Scattered reports across chat channels and spreadsheets.
- Lack of context for reported issues (screenshots, execution logs).
- Difficulty in tracking issue resolution status per customer.
- Absence of aggregated insights to identify recurring model failures.

**FDE Accuracy Tracker** solves this by providing a centralized, structured, and visual platform for managing the entire lifecycle of accuracy issues.

## ✨ Features

- **📂 Customer-Centric Organization**: Create and manage isolated workspaces for each customer.
- **📝 Detailed Issue Tracking**: Record comprehensive details including model used, workflow, execution logs, and proposed fixes.
- **📸 Screenshot Gallery**: Visual browsing of issues with a dedicated gallery view, linking images back to their specific issue context.
- **📊 Insights Dashboard**: Real-time analytics on issue categories, resolution status, and reporting trends over time.
- **⚡ Demo Mode**: Built-in offline mode allows exploration of features without backend configuration.
